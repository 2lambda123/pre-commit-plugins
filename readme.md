# pre-commit-plugins

> Welcome to our `pre-commit` plugins repository. There are many like it (<https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html>), but this one is ours. Automation is our best friend, it is our life. We must master is as we must master our lives. Without me, our automation continues to work in CI. Without our automation, we must manually test things. We must run our automation true. We must ship software faster than our competitors, who are trying to ... compete. We will. Before God we swear this creed: our automation and ourselves are defenders of the integrity of our products, we are the masters of our software codes, we are the saviors of shipping fast and iterating with confidence. So be it, until there is no competition, but peace. Amen.

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to

* automate formatting (since that saves time and inconsistency within code-review)
* lint as much as we can (same reason)
* run such checks in a consistent way on developer workstations (saving CI costs and reducing cycle-time)
