# Contributing

Standard github pull-request flow.

1. Open a ticket to check whether your change is welcome ahead of offering it, to avoid investing your time into something that won't be merged.
1. Make a new branch.
1. Make the changes you want.
1. Have passing `pre-commit` locally.
    * Offering a change here is making the assumption you are, yourself, a user of `pre-commit` and have it installed and wired up so you can run it locally.
1. Open a pull request and ask for review.
1. We'll process as fast as we're able.
